# Aparecida Nutrição

## About the project

Project developed during the course "JavaScript para Web", at Alura formation on JavaScript. The objective of this course was to use JavaScript to capture data from a form and add to a table with pre-existing information. Also, JS was used do import data from a database to the same table.

The idea is let a nutricionist user add, delete and import pacient data to a table. Also, a search bar was added to help user filter the pacients' names.

## Technologies

For this projected, the initial HTML and CSS codes were given, so that JS was the language used to implement all features desired for the course.

## Experience

During this project I could for the first time learn how do access data from an API, importing data. This kind of coding, reggarding requests and promises for example, is still new to me and I feel I still have to practice much more until it becomes an easy feature to implement through future projects.
